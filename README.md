# :newspaper: Nestable React MUI Menu

This is a mobile friendly MUI (v5) menu with infinitely nestable sub-menus.

Changes the content of the menu based on which sub-menu is currently active, keeping the menu in a compact form allowing for easy mobile integration.

## :information_desk_person: Exports

The following components (and corresponding interfaces) are exported:

- `NestableMenu` - The raw menu component. This will require the anchor element to be managed externally.

- `NestableMenuButton` - A MUI button wrapping the Menu component, handling the anchoring internally.
